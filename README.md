# WarthogDB
A minimalist key-value non-SQL database made in Go.

# Story
This is a little program I wrote in a few hours to have some fun with Go.
Nothing is really optimized, but it is functional.

# How does it work?
You can clone the repo and use `go run main.go`.
To continue I decided to create a small CLI to use it using Dart.
